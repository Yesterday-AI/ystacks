# using-github

Operating policies for interacting with GitHub via `gh` and `git`. Read before any PR / branch / push action. The rules below exist because each one was learned from a real failure.

## P1: Check PR state before any edit or comment

**Rule:** before `gh pr edit`, `gh pr comment`, `gh pr review`, or any mutation on a PR, run:

```bash
gh pr view <num> --json state,mergedAt,closed --jq '.state, .mergedAt, .closed'
```

If `state` is `MERGED` or `CLOSED`: **stop**. The mutation will silently no-op or land in an unintended place. Tell the human, ask whether to open a follow-up PR instead.

**Why:** `gh pr edit` on a merged PR returns success but does not change the visible body. `gh pr comment` on a closed PR posts to the closed PR (which nobody will see). Both are silent failures.

**How to apply:** any time more than 5 minutes have passed since the last `gh pr view`, or any time someone else might have merged in the meantime, re-check state first. Treat PR state as live data that decays fast.

## P2: Verify mutations actually landed

**Rule:** after every `gh pr edit`, `gh pr comment`, `gh issue edit`, etc., re-fetch the resource and confirm the change is visible:

```bash
gh pr view <num> --json body --jq '.body' | head -20
```

Stderr warnings (e.g. `GraphQL: Projects (classic) is being deprecated...`) are not the same as failure -- but they are also not the same as success. Always verify with a re-fetch. Exit code 0 from `gh` means the request was accepted; it does not mean your change is live (see P1).

**Why:** the `gh` CLI prints warnings to stderr and continues. A merged-PR edit returns 0 but does nothing visible.

## P3: Verify branch before every commit

**Rule:** before every `git commit`, run:

```bash
git branch --show-current
```

Confirm the branch is what you expect. Do not trust that the branch from 10 minutes ago is still the active one -- `git checkout`, hook switches, and worktree changes can move it.

**Why:** committing to the wrong branch (especially main when you meant a feature branch) is hard to unwind. Cherry-picking after the fact loses author/timestamp context.

## P4: Never force-push, with one exception

**Rule:** never `git push --force` or `git push -f`. If you genuinely need to overwrite remote history (e.g. squash before review, fix a wrong commit message), use `git push --force-with-lease` AND only with the human's explicit, in-this-session consent.

**Why:** force-push overwrites collaborators' work irrecoverably. `--force-with-lease` aborts if anyone else has pushed since your last fetch, which is the safety net `--force` lacks. Even with `--force-with-lease`, the human should know.

**How to apply:** when tempted to force-push: stop, describe what you want to do, ask. Do not assume past consent applies to a new force-push.

## P5: Never destructively reset working-tree changes

**Rule:** never `git checkout <file>`, `git restore <file>`, `git reset --hard`, or `git clean -fd` on uncommitted changes that you did not personally just write. If your own edits are wrong on disk, use the `Edit` tool with explicit `old_string` / `new_string` reverts instead.

**Why:** the working tree may contain the human's uncommitted edits that you never saw. Discarding them silently destroys hours of work.

**How to apply:** when the working tree is unexpectedly modified, ask: "I see uncommitted changes to <files> -- should I commit, stash, or wait?" Do not unilaterally clean.

## P6: Squash-merge divergence -- branch fresh, do not rebase

**Rule:** when a PR is squash-merged, the original branch diverges from `origin/main` (the squash creates a new commit; the branch's commits remain visible in history but unreachable from main). To continue work:

```bash
git fetch origin
git checkout main && git pull
git checkout -b <new-branch-name>  # branch fresh from updated main
```

Do NOT `git rebase main` on the old branch -- it will replay the original commits onto the squash, producing duplicate work. Do NOT `git push --force` to "clean up" the old branch.

**Why:** rebase-after-squash is the most common cause of duplicated commits and the second-most common reason for "why is my PR diff huge".

## P7: Read PR comments before claiming "done"

**Rule:** when an automated reviewer (Bugbot, CodeRabbit, Renovate, etc.) leaves comments on a PR, read them before declaring the PR ready or before merging. Address each comment explicitly: either fix the issue, push back with reasoning, or note why it is out of scope.

**Why:** silently ignored review comments accumulate technical debt and erode reviewer trust. Bugbot in particular catches real issues (security, bugs, type holes).

```bash
gh pr view <num> --json comments,reviews --jq '.comments[].body, .reviews[].body'
```

## P8: Pull before branching from main

**Rule:** before `git checkout -b <new-branch>` from main, always:

```bash
git checkout main && git pull --no-rebase
```

A stale local main as the branch base means your PR's "additions" diff includes other people's commits, which makes review noisy and risks reverting their work via merge conflicts.

**Why:** working from a stale base produces PRs that look like they are reverting unrelated changes.

## P9: Pass PR bodies via `--body-file`, not inline

**Rule:** when creating or editing a PR with multi-line body content, write the body to a temp file and pass `--body-file /tmp/<file>.md`:

```bash
gh pr create --title "..." --body-file /tmp/pr-body.md
gh pr edit <num> --body-file /tmp/pr-body.md
```

Do not pass multi-line bodies via inline `--body "$(cat <<EOF ...)"` heredocs -- they interact badly with shell quoting, history expansion, and special characters.

**Why:** inline heredocs can silently truncate or mangle content, especially with backticks, dollar signs, or em-dashes.

## P10: Keep `gh auth` and `git push` aligned

**Rule:** after `gh auth switch`, also run:

```bash
gh auth setup-git
```

Otherwise `git push` may use a stale credential from the macOS Keychain, overriding the active gh auth identity.

**Why:** `gh auth switch` only updates the gh CLI's internal token; it does not propagate to `git push`. Symptoms: pushing to a repo as the wrong user, "permission denied" despite `gh auth status` showing the right user.

## P11: Sync org-level repo lists on visibility changes / new repos

**Rule:** when adding a new repo to a GitHub org OR flipping an existing repo's visibility (private ↔ public), check whether the org maintains profile-style repo lists in `<org>/.github` (public profile) and/or `<org>/.github-private` (private member-only landing). If either exists and lists repos, update them as part of the same change set:

- Public profile (`<org>/.github/profile/README.md`): list/unlist the repo in the relevant table.
- Private landing (`<org>/.github-private/profile/README.md` or equivalent): update the visibility marker (e.g. `🌐` ↔ `🔒` columns are a common convention) and any catalog summaries that mention the repo by name.
- Also sweep for sibling files in those repos (e.g. curated `IMPORTANT-REPOS.md` or similar) and surface them to the human if found.

```bash
gh repo view <org>/.github --json visibility 2>/dev/null
gh repo view <org>/.github-private --json visibility 2>/dev/null
```

If neither exists, this rule does not apply.

**Why:** the public profile is the org's outward-facing landing page; out-of-date listings either advertise repos that 404 for non-members or hide repos that are actually public. The private landing typically uses a `Vis` column to mirror public state -- drift means org members get a wrong picture of what is shareable. Both files are easy to forget because they live in their own repos, separate from the repo whose visibility is changing.

**How to apply:** when the human asks for a visibility flip or a new-repo addition, treat the org-list update as a sibling task in the same plan, with its own PR(s) per repo. The human should not need to remind you.

## Quick reference

| Switch GitHub identity | `gh auth switch && gh auth setup-git` |
| Visibility flip / new repo | also update `<org>/.github/profile/README.md` and `<org>/.github-private/profile/README.md` if they exist |

## When in doubt

If a GitHub action might be irreversible (force-push, branch delete, PR close, repo settings change), describe it to the human and ask before running. The cost of a 10-second confirmation is much less than the cost of an unrecoverable mistake.
